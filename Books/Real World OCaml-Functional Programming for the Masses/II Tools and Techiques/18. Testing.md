### Testing with dune 
#### Inline Tests with `let%test`
- `let%test` allows you to embed tests directly within your code.

#### Boolean Tests
```ocaml
open Base
let%test "rev" =
	List.equal Int.equal (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 1; 2; 3 ]
```
- This test checks if the reverse of the list `[3; 2; 1]` is equal to `[1; 2; 3]`. The `dune runtest` command executes these tests.
- If a test fails, dune will report the line number and a failure message. For instance:
```bash
File "test.ml", line 3, characters 0-74: rev is false. FAILED 1 / 1 tests

Equality Tests with let%test_eq

The let%test_eq construct is used for testing equality, but it can sometimes throw an exception if the comparison fails.

open Base
let%test_eq "rev" = int list (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 3; 2; 1 ]

If the test fails, it might raise an exception like:

File "test.ml", line 3, characters 0-79: rev threw (duniverse/ppx_assert/runtime-lib/runtime.ml.E "comparison failed" ((1 2 3) vs (3 2 1) (Loc test.ml:4:13))).
```

### Expect Tests and `[%expect]`
- Expect tests capture the output of a program and compare it against expected output stored in the source file.
- Basic Usage
```ocaml
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "trivial" =
	print_endline "Hello World!";
	[%expect {| Hello World! |}]
```
- This test prints "Hello World!" and asserts that the output matches the expected value.

#### Running Expect Tests
- When an expect test fails, dune generates `a .corrected` file containing the expected output. You can use dune promote to update the original source file with the corrected output.

#### Multi-block Expect Tests
- You can have multiple blocks in expect tests:
```ocaml
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "multi-block" =
	print_endline "Hello";
	[%expect {| Hello |}];
	print_endline "World!";
	[%expect {| World! |}]
```

#### Testing Data Structures with [%sexp]
- The `[%sexp]` construct converts OCaml values into s-expressions for testing purposes.
```ocaml
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "test" =
	print_s [%sexp (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ] : int list)];
	[%expect {| (1 2 3) |}]
```

### Testing External Commands with `patdiff`
- `patdiff` is used to compare the output of external commands with expected results. This is often used for testing programs that generate text files. It's set up to compare the current test file with `a .corrected` version, highlighting differences.

### Parsing HTML with lambdasoup 
- `lambdasoup` is a library for parsing and manipulating HTML.
```ocaml
open Base
open Stdio

let%expect_test "test" =
	let html = {|
		<html>
			Some random <b>text</b> with a <a href="http://ocaml.org/base">link</a>.
			And here's another <a href="http://github.com/ocaml/dune">link</a>.
			And here is <a>link</a> with no href.
		</html>|} 
	in
	let soup = Soup.parse html in
	let hrefs =
		Soup.select "a[href]" soup
		|> Soup.to_list
		|> List.map ~f:(Soup.attribute "href")
		|> Set.of_list (module String)
	in
	print_s [%sexp (hrefs : Set.M(String).t)];
	[%expect {| (http://github.com/ocaml/dune http://ocaml.org/base) |}]
```
- This code snippet demonstrates how to:
	- Parse an HTML string using `Soup.parse`.
	- Select all `<a>` tags with an `href` attribute using `Soup.select "a[href]" soup`.
- To extract just the host names from the URLs, you can use the `Uri` library:
```ocaml
open Base
open Stdio
open Uri

let%expect_test "test" =
	let html = {|
		<html>
			Some random <b>text</b> with a <a href="http://ocaml.org/base">link</a>.
			And here's another <a href="http://github.com/ocaml/dune">link</a>.
			And here is <a>link</a> with no href.
		</html>|} 
	in
	let soup = Soup.parse html in
	let hrefs =
		Soup.select "a[href]" soup
			|> Soup.to_list
			|> List.filter_map ~f:(fun node ->
				Option.bind (Soup.attribute "href" node) ~f:Uri.of_string 
				|> Uri.host)
			|> Set.of_list (module String)
	in
	print_s [%sexp (hrefs : Set.M(String).t)];
	[%expect {| (github.com ocaml.org) |}]
```

### Quoting Strings 
- OCaml provides different ways to quote strings, including handling literal quotes.
- Basic string:
```ocaml
{|This is a quoted string|};;
```
- Literal quote:
```ocaml
{|This is a literal quote: "|};;
```
- Complex quoting:
```ocaml
{xxx|This is how you quote a {|quoted string|}|xxx};;
```

### Rate Limiter Example 
- This example demonstrates a rate limiter implementation using `Core`.
- Interface (`mli file`)
```ocaml
open Core

type t

val create :  Time_ns.t -> period:Time_ns.Span.t -> rate:int -> t
val consume : t -> now:Time_ns.t -> [ `Consumed | `No_capacity ]
```
- Implementation
```ocaml
open Core

let limiter ~now ~period ~rate =
	let q = Queue.create () in
	{ Limiter.now = now; period; rate; events = q }

let consume lim offset =
	let now = Time_ns.add lim.now offset in
	let result = Limiter.consume lim ~now in
	printf "%4.2f: %s\n" (Time_ns.Span.to_sec offset)
		(match result with
		| `Consumed -> "C"
		| `No_capacity -> "N");
	result

let rec drain_old_events t =
	match Queue.peek t.events with
	| None -> ()
	| Some time ->
		if Time_ns.( < ) (Time_ns.add t.now t.period) time
		then (ignore (Queue.dequeue_exn t.events) : Time_ns.t; drain_old_events t)
		else ()
```
- Explanation:
	- ***Create a rate limiter***:
	    - Create a rate limiter with a period of 1 second and a rate of 2.
	- ***Consume tokens***:
	    - Try to consume tokens without advancing the clock.
	    - The first two attempts succeed, and the third fails because the rate limit is exhausted.
	- ***Wait and try again***:
	    - Wait until half a second has elapsed and try again. This still fails because the period hasn't fully elapsed.
	    - Wait until a full second has elapsed and try again. This succeeds because the period has elapsed, and the rate limiter has capacity again.

### Testing Asynchronous Code with Async 
- This section covers testing asynchronous code using the Async library.
- Echo Server Example
- The example involves testing an echo server. The test sets up a server, connects to it, sends data, and verifies the response.
- Helper Functions:
```ocaml
open! Core
open Async

(** Launches the echo server *)
val launch : port:int -> uppercase:bool -> Process.t Deferred.t

(** Connects to the echo server, returning a reader and writer for communicating with the server. *)
val connect : port:int -> (Reader.t * Writer.t) Deferred.t

(** Sends data to the server, printing out the result *)
val send : Reader.t -> Writer.t -> string -> unit Deferred.t

(** Kills the echo server, and waits until it exits *)
val cleanup : Process.t -> unit Deferred.t

Test Case

open! Core
open Async
open Helpers

let%expect_test "test uppercase echo" =
	let port = 8081 in
	let%bind process = launch ~port ~uppercase:true in
	Monitor.protect (fun () ->
		let%bind () = Clock.after (Time.Span.of_sec 1.) in
		let%bind (r,w) = connect ~port in
		let%bind () = send r w "one two three\n" in
		let%bind () = [%expect{| ONE TWO THREE |}] in
		let%bind () = send r w "one 2 three\n" in
		let%bind () = [%expect{| ONE 2 THREE |}] in
		return ())
	~finally:(fun () -> cleanup process)
```
- Explanation:
	- ***Launch the echo server***:
		- The launch function starts the echo server on a specified port and indicates whether the server should convert the input to uppercase.
    - ***Connect to the server***:
        - The connect function establishes a connection to the echo server and returns a reader and writer for communication.
        - A `Clock.after` is added before the attempt to connect to allow the server time to start.
        - The connect function retries every 0.01 seconds until a connection is established.
    - ***Send data and verify the response***:
	    - The send function sends data to the server and prints the result.
	    - `[%expect]` is used to verify that the server's response matches the expected output.
    - ***Cleanup***:
        - The cleanup function terminates the echo server and waits for it to exit.

#### Retry Logic for Connection
- The connect function uses a recursive approach with `Clock.after` to retry the connection if it initially fails. This handles cases where the server might not be immediately available.
```ocaml
let rec connect ~port =
	match%bind (fun () -> Tcp.connect { host = "localhost"; port })) with
	| Ok (_, r, w) -> return (r, w)
	| Error _ ->
	let%bind () = Clock.after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.01) in
	connect ~port
```

### Working with Signs ➕➖
- The `Sign` module in OCaml is used to represent the sign of an integer.
- Sign Types
```ocaml
Int.sign : int -> Sign.t
Sign.t : Positive | Negative | Zero
```

#### Sign Operations
- Negation: The `Int.neg` function negates an integer.
- Flipping: The `Sign.flip` function flips the sign.

#### Testing Sign Properties
```ocaml
open Core

let%test "negation flips the sign" =
	Quickcheck.test
		~sexp_of:[%sexp_of: int]
		(Quickcheck.Generator.int)
		~f:(fun x ->
			[%test_eq: Sign.t] (Int.sign (Int.neg x)) (Sign.flip (Int.sign x)))
```
- This test uses `Quickcheck` to verify that negating an integer and then taking its sign is the same as flipping the sign of the original integer.

### List Operations 
- The `List.rev_append` function reverses the first list and appends it to the second list. It's equivalent to appending the reverse of the first list to the second list.
- Testing `List.rev_append`
```ocaml
open Core

let%test "List.rev_append is List.append of List.rev" =
	Quickcheck.test 
	~sexp_of:[%sexp_of: int list * int list]
	(Quickcheck.Generator.both (Quickcheck.Generator.list (Quickcheck.Generator.int)))
    ~f:(fun (l1, l2) ->
		[%test_eq: int list] (List.rev_append l1 l2) (List.append (List.rev l1) l2))
```
- This test uses `Quickcheck` to verify that `List.rev_append l1 l2` is equivalent to `List.append (List.rev l1) l2`.

### `Quickcheck` and Custom Types 
- You can use `Quickcheck` with custom types by deriving a generator for the type.
- Defining a Custom Type
```ocaml
type shape =
	| Circle of { radius: float }
	| Rect of { height: float; width: float }
	| Poly of (float * float) list
[@@deriving quickcheck]
```
- The `[@@deriving quickcheck]` syntax automatically generates a `Quickcheck` generator for the shape type.
- Modifying Weights
```ocaml
type shape =
	| Circle of { radius: float } [@quickcheck.weight 0.5]
	| Rect of { height: float; width: float }
	| Poly of (float * float) list
[@@deriving quickcheck]
```
- This assigns a weight of 0.5 to the `Circle` constructor, making it more likely to be generated by `Quickcheck`. The remaining 0.5 weight is equally distributed between `Rect` and `Poly`, i.e. 0.25 each.

#### Custom Generators
- You can create custom generators for more complex types using let%bind and G.map.
```ocaml
open Quickcheck.Generator.Let_syntax

let shape =
	let circle =
		let%map radius = Float.gen_positive in
		Circle { radius }
	in
	let rect =
		let%bind height = Float.gen_positive in
		let%map width = Float.gen_positive in
		Rect { height; width }
	in
	let poly =
		let%map points = 
			List.gen (Pair.gen Float.gen_positive Float.gen_positive) 
		in
		Poly points
	in
	Quickcheck.Generator.union [ circle; rect; poly ]
```
