### What Is Async?
- Async is a monadic, cooperative concurrency library for OCaml.
- It enables writing non-blocking, event-driven programs using `Deferred.t` values and scheduling callbacks.

### Motivation
- Synchronous blocking I/O (e.g. reading big files or network) stalls the whole program.
- `Async` builds a scheduler that interleaves I/O without needing threads, using `Deferred.t` for computations that complete later.

### Basics: `Deferreds` `Ivars`, `upon`
- `Deferred.t` represents a value available in the future.
- `Ivar.t` is a write-once placeholder. You create it with `Ivar.create`, read deferred with `Ivar.read`, and fill it via `Ivar.fill`.
- upon registers callbacks:
```ocaml
upon deferred (fun result -> ... ) 
```
runs after resolution.

### Reader and Writer
- `Async` offers `Reader.t` and `Writer.t` for stream I/O.
- Uniform interfaces simplify reading/writing files, sockets, stdin/stdout, etc.

### TCP Server & `Flow.copy`
- Building a TCP echo server follows:
    - Accept connections.
    - Use `Reader.pipe` and `Writer.pipe`.
    - `Flow.copy` copies bytes from reader to writer non-blockingly.

### Scheduling and Delays
- Async supports timers via:
```ocaml
Clock.after (Time.Span.of_sec 1.0)
```
 which returns a deferred after 1â€¯sec.
-  Combined with upon, it enables delayed task execution.

### Resource Management: `Monitors`
- A `Monitor` supervises async computations.
- Failures in deferred tasks propagate to their monitor.
- You can attach exception handlers to stay robust under errors.

### Composition: `choose`
- `Async` offers combinators like `Deferred.both`, `all`, and `choose`:
    - `choose` returns once the first deferred completes.
    - Useful for race conditions or timeouts.

### System Threads
- You can mix `Async` with real OS threads via:
    - `In_thread.run` to perform blocking operations in separate threads.
    - Avoid shared mutable state unless protected by mutexes (`Mutex` or `Nano_mutex`).
- Use `Thread_safe` to interoperate safely between threads and `Async` scheduler.

### Key Constraints
- Async offers cooperative scheduling, so doing blocking work blocks all tasks.
- Always offload blocking operations with `In_thread.run`.
- Design to avoid mutable shared state across threads.

### Example: `Delayer`
```ocaml
module Delayer : sig
	type t
	val create : Time.Span.t -> t
	val schedule : t -> (unit -> unit Deferred.t) -> unit Deferred.t
end = struct
	(* simplified based on book's Ivar + Timer logic *)
end
```
- Creates a scheduler that queues jobs to run after delays.
- Internally uses `Ivars`, deferred timers, and upon to manage execution order.

### Why Use Async?
- Enables efficient I/O-heavy and networked programs without threads.
- Offers:
    - Deferred-based control flow (`let%bind`, `Deferred.map`, `choose`)
    - Clean scheduling and error handling
    - Scalable architecture (`readers`, `writers`, `monitors`, `timers`)
    - A path to integrate with system threads when needed
