### Garbage Collection in OCaml
- OCaml uses a generational garbage collector to manage memory automatically.
- The GC groups allocations by generation based on age.
- Values are automatically freed when they are no longer reachable from the program.

#### Important Concepts:
- Generational hypothesis: most allocated values die quickly.
- GC efficiency relies on fast collection of young (short-lived) objects.

### Minor and Major Heaps
- OCaml splits memory into:
    - Minor heap: where most allocations happen, collected frequently and very fast.
    - Major heap: used for long-lived values that survive minor collections.
- Minor collections are extremely fast because they:
    - Only scan new allocations.
    - Avoid scanning the entire memory.

#### How Promotion Works:
- Values surviving minor GC cycles get promoted to the major heap.

### Incremental Major Collections
- The major heap is collected incrementally to prevent long pause times.
- Instead of stopping the world, OCaml does sliced major collections, where:
    - Only part of the major heap is collected at a time (a "slice").
    - This allows smoother execution in interactive or latency-sensitive programs.
-  This prevents big latency spikes caused by full garbage collections.

### `OCAMLRUNPARAM` and Runtime GC Tuning
- GC parameters can be set via the `OCAMLRUNPARAM` environment variable.

#### Examples:
```bash
OCAMLRUNPARAM="s=256k" ./program.exe
```
- Common `OCAMLRUNPARAM` options:
    - `s`: minor heap size in words.
    - `a`: allocation policy (e.g., `a=0 first-fit`, `a=1 next-fit`, `a=2 best-fit`).
    - `o`: space overhead for incremental major GC.
    - `O`: maximum overhead to trigger compaction.
    - `v`: verbose GC debugging output.

#### Useful for:
- Quick runtime experiments.
- Testing GC behavior without changing code.

### Allocation Policies: First-fit, Next-fit, Best-fit
- OCaml provides multiple allocation strategies for major heap allocations:

#### First-fit (a=0):
- Allocator chooses the first free memory block large enough to satisfy the allocation request.
- Tends to leave many small unusable holes in memory (fragmentation).

#### Next-fit (a=1):
- Like first-fit, but starts searching where the last allocation left off.
- Can improve performance in some allocation patterns by reducing search time.

#### Best-fit (a=2):
- Allocator chooses the smallest available block that satisfies the allocation.
- Reduces wasted space but can increase allocation time due to longer search.

#### OCaml Default:
- Next-fit (a=1) is the default setting in OCaml.
- You can override it:
```ocaml
Gc.tune ~allocation_policy:First_fit ();;
```

#### Use Cases:
- Use `best-fit` to reduce fragmentation if allocation overhead is acceptable.
- Use `first-fit` to simulate simpler allocation behavior.
- Stick with `next-fit` for general cases.

### `Gc` Module and Runtime Tuning from Code
- You can inspect and tune GC from OCaml code:
```ocaml
let c = Gc.get ();;
Gc.tune ~minor_heap_size:(262144 * 2) ();;
```

#### Common tunable fields in `Gc.tune`:
- `minor_heap_size`: size of minor heap (in words).
- `major_heap_increment`: how much to grow the major heap after each collection.
- `space_overhead`: controls aggressiveness of incremental GC.
- `max_overhead`: threshold to trigger compaction.
- `allocation_policy`: selects the allocation strategy (`first`, `next`, `best-fit`).

### Forcing Collections Manually
- You can manually trigger GC using:
```ocaml
Gc.major_slice 0;;  (* forces a slice of major collection *)
Gc.full_major ();;   (* forces full major collection *)
```

#### Notes:
- `major_slice` can be called in loops to spread out GC effort.
- `full_major` forces immediate collection but causes a full pause.

### Measuring Allocations with `Core_bench`
- Install core_bench to benchmark code allocation behavior:
```bash
opam install core_bench
```

#### Benchmark Scenario:
- Compares mutable vs. immutable counters.

#### Mutable Example:
```ocaml
module Mutable = struct
type t = { mutable iters : int; mutable count : float }
let rec test t =
	if t.iters = 0 then ()
	else (
		t.iters <- t.iters - 1;
		t.count <- t.count +. 1.0;
		test t)
end
```

#### Immutable Example:
```ocaml
module Immutable = struct
type t = { iters : int; count : float }
let rec test t =
	if t.iters = 0 then ()
	else test { iters = t.iters - 1; count = t.count +. 1.0 }
end
```

#### Bench Setup:
```ocaml
let () =
	let iters = 1_000_000 in
	let count = 0.0 in
	let tests = [
		Bench.Test.create 
			~name:"mutable" 
			(fun () -> Mutable.test { iters; count });
		Bench.Test.create 
			~name:"immutable" 
			(fun () -> Immutable.test { iters; count });
		] 
	in
	Bench.make_command tests |> Command.run
```

#### Interpretation:
- Mutable state reduces allocation but hits the OCaml runtime write barrier.
- Immutable code allocates more but avoids barrier overhead.
- Results vary depending on metric (e.g., time, words allocated, GC frequency).

### Finalizers with `Gc.add_finalizer`

### Finalizer:
- A function attached to a heap-allocated value that runs after it is unreachable.
- Used to release external resources (file handles, network connections).

#### Important:
- Only heap-allocated values can have finalizers.
- Immediate values (e.g., integers) cannot have finalizers attached.

#### Example:
```ocaml
let attach_finalizer n v =
	match Heap_block.create v with
	| None -> printf "%20s: FAIL\n%!" n
	| Some hb ->
		let final _ = printf "%20s: OK\n%!" n in
		Gc.add_finalizer hb final
```

#### Usage Example:
```ocaml
attach_finalizer "allocated string" (Bytes.create 4);;
Gc.compact ();;
```

#### `Heap_block.create`:
- Helps determine if a value is heap-allocated.
- Returns `None` for immediates, `Some` for blocks.

#### `Gc.compact ()`:
- Reduces fragmentation in major heap by compacting live data together.
