### Mutable Variables
- OCaml provides mutable references using the `ref` type:
```ocaml
let x = ref 0
!x      (* dereference *)
x := 1  (* assignment *)
```
- `ref` cells are used for local mutation, not global shared state.
- Best used sparingly and locally for clarity and safety.

### Mutable Record Fields
- Fields can be declared `mutable` in record definitions:
```ocaml
type counter = { mutable count: int }
```
- Mutating a field 
```ocaml
c.count <- c.count + 1
```
- Prefer immutable records unless mutation is truly necessary

### Arrays
- Arrays are fixed-size, `mutable` sequences
```ocaml
let arr = [| 1; 2; 3 |]
arr.(1) <- 42
```
- Unlike lists, arrays support constant-time indexing
- Common operations: `Array.map`, `Array.iter`
- Arrays are zero-based by default

### Loops 
- While loop
```ocaml
while condition do
	(* body *)
done
```
- For loop
```ocaml
for i = 0 to 10 do
	(* body *)
done
```
- Loops are statements, not expressions (return unit)
- Loop constructs are most useful when interacting with mutable data

### Sequencing 
- Multiple expressions can be sequenced using `;`
```ocaml
expr1;
expr2;
```
- Used for side-effect ordering
- Semicolon sequencing returns the result of the last expression

### The `unit` Type
- Used when a function returns no meaningful value
```ocaml
print_endline : string -> unit
```
- Function with no arguments
```ocaml
unit -> 'a
```
- The literal value is written as `()`

### Using Imperative Features Wisely 
- OCaml allows imperative style but encourages functional purity when possible.
- Use imperative features locally and deliberately, especially in performance-critical or I/O-heavy code.
- Combining pure functional logic with controlled side effects yields clean, maintainable programs.
