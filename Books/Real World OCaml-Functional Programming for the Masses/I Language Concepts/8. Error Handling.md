### Exceptions
- Declared with `exception`:
```ocaml
exception Not_found
```
- Raised using `raise` and caught using `try ... with`:
```ocaml
try some_function () 
with Not_found -> default_value
```
- Exceptions are runtime constructs, not reflected in the function’s type.
- Use exceptions for truly exceptional, unrecoverable errors, not normal control flow.

### Option type
- Used for computations that may succeed or fail with “no result”:
```ocaml
type 'a option = None | Some of 'a
```
- Promotes explicit handling:
```ocaml
match maybe_value with
| Some x -> ...
| None -> ...
```

### Result type
- Preferred for operations that may fail with a specific error:
```ocaml
type ('a, 'b) result = Ok of 'a | Error of 'b
```
- Allows error values to carry information (e.g., strings, enums).
- Encourages clear success/failure modeling in types.

### Pattern matching with result
- Makes failure cases visible and explicit:
```ocaml
match parse_input input with
| Ok v -> use v
| Error msg -> report msg
```

### Converting between styles 
- Use helper functions to go between option, result, and exception-based APIs:
    - `Option.to_result`, `Result.to_option`
    - `Result.of_exn`, etc.

### Prefer pure error-handling
- The failure is expected or recoverable.
- You want to enforce handling through the type system.

### Prefer exceptions when
- You're dealing with programmer mistakes, not user input.
- The failure is non-local and truly exceptional.
- Use standard libraries like `Result`, `Option`, and tools from `Base`/`Core` for safer error management.
