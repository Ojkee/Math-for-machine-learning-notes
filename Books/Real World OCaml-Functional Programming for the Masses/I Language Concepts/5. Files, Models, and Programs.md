 ### Module Basics
- OCaml code is organized into modules, which correspond directly to files:
	- `foo.ml` defines a module named `Foo`.
    - An optional `foo.mli` file declares the module interface.
- The module system provides:
    - Namespacing — helps avoid name collisions across files.
    - Abstraction and information hiding — through interfaces.
    - Code reuse and structure — organize logic by responsibility.

### Opening and Aliasing
- Use `open` to bring a module’s contents into the current scope:
    - Use sparingly — prefer qualified names like `List.map` to retain clarity.
- Modules can be aliased:
```ocaml
module M = MyLongModuleName
```
- You can also define nested modules for structure.

### Compiling Multi-File Programs
- To compile code spanning multiple files:
    - Use `ocamlc` (bytecode) or `ocamlopt` (native).
    - Files must be passed in dependency order.
    - `.mli` interface files (if present) must be compiled before the corresponding `.ml` files.
```bash
ocamlopt mod1.mli mod1.ml mod2.ml -o myprog
```

### Using Modules in utop
- In `utop`, you can load:
    - Source files with `#use "file.ml"` (useful for quick tests).
    - Modules with `#mod_use "file.ml"` (brings definitions into scope as a module).
    - Compiled code and libraries with:
        - `#load "module.cmo"`
        - `#require "package"` (via `ocamlfind` or `dune`).

### Writing Executables
- Small programs can live entirely in a single `.ml` file.
- Compile with:
```bash
ocamlopt unix.cmxa yourfile.ml -o yourprog
```
- The `Unix` module provides access to:
    - File I/O, processes, environment variables, time, etc.

### Project Structure Best Practices
- Keep related functionality together in a single module (file).
- Use multiple files for organizing complex projects logically.
- Group types, functions, and submodules around a shared concept or responsibility.

### Interfaces (.mli Files)
- `.mli` files define module interfaces:
    - Specify which names (types, functions) are exposed.
    - Hide internal details — enforcing encapsulation.
    - Act as documentation and aid compile-time checking.
- Interfaces are optional, but recommended for:
    - Large modules or reusable libraries.
    - Controlling public API and hiding implementation details.

### Immutability and State
- Module contents are immutable by default.
- If needed, mutable state can be included using:
    - Refs
    - Mutable fields in records
    - Imperative constructs (used sparingly
