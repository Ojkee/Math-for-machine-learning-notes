- Variants (also known as sum types) allow defining types with multiple distinct cases.
    - Each case is called a constructor, and can optionally carry associated data.

- Defined using the **type** keyword and the **|** separator:
	- **type color = Red | Green | Blue**

- Constructors can carry arguments of any type:
	- **type shape = Circle of float | Rectangle of float * float**

- Pattern matching is the primary way to analyze variants:
    - Requires covering all cases or using a wildcard _.
	- Enables type-safe dispatch on variant values.

- Constructors are capitalized by convention, unlike record field names.

- Variants can be recursive — useful for defining trees, expressions, and linked structures.

- Polymorphic variants (\`) offer more flexibility and open extension but have trade-offs (covered in a later chapter).

- You can define parameterized variant types using type variables:
	- **type 'a option = None | Some of 'a**

- When using pattern matching:
    - Prefer exhaustive matches.
    - Use guards (**when**) to refine patterns conditionally.
    - Use **\_** only when truly appropriate — it can hide missed cases.

- You can combine variants with records for structured tagged data.

- OCaml variants are not enums — they are rich types capable of modeling full data structures.

- Variants are critical for modeling domain logic and algebraic data types (ADTs).
