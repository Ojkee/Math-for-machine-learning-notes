### What Are Variants?
- Variants (also called sum types) define types with multiple distinct cases.
- Each case is a constructor, which may carry associated values.

### Defining Variants
- Use the `type` keyword with the `|` separator:
```ocaml
type color =
	| Red
	| Green
	| Blue
```

### Constructors can carry arguments of any type:
```ocaml
type shape =
	| Circle of float
	| Rectangle of float * float
```
- By convention, constructors are capitalized.

### Pattern Matching
- Pattern matching is the main tool for working with variants:
    - Enables type-safe deconstruction.
    - Requires exhaustiveness — the compiler warns if any cases are missing.
    - Use `_` only when you intentionally want to ignore unmatched cases.
- You can use guards to refine matches:
```ocaml
match s with
| Circle r when r < 1.0 -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

### Recursive Variants
- Variants can be recursive, enabling structures like trees or expressions:
```ocaml
type expr =
	| Num of int
	| Add of expr * expr
	| Mul of expr * expr
```

### Polymorphic Variants
- Polymorphic variants use backticks and allow open definitions:
	- More flexible, extensible.
    - Introduced later — not interchangeable with regular variants.

### Parameterized Variants
- Use type variables to define generic variants:
```ocaml
type 'a option =
	| None
	| Some of 'a
```

### Variants and Records
- You can combine variants and records to create tagged structured data:
```ocaml
type message =
	| Text of { sender : string; content : string }
	| Ping
```

### Key Properties
- OCaml variants are not enums — they can carry rich data.
- Essential for:
    - Modeling domain logic.
    - Implementing algebraic data types (ADTs).
    - Structuring interpreters, protocols, compilers, etc.
