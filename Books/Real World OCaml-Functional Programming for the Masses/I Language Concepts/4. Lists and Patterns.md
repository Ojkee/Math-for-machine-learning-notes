- Lists are a built-in, immutable, singly-linked data structure.

- A list is either:
	- the empty list (**[]**), or
	- an element prepended to another list using the cons operator (**::**).

- All elements in a list must have the same type (homogeneous).

- You can concatenate lists with the **@** operator, but this has linear cost relative to the length of the first list.

- Accessing elements by index requires recursion or pattern matching; there's no random-access like arrays.

- Pattern matching (**match ... with**) is the primary tool for working with list structures:
	- Enables destructuring values based on shape.
    - Patterns can bind variables to elements or substructures.

- Patterns can be used in **let** bindings to destructure values (e.g., **tuples, lists**).

- The match construct must be exhaustive; OCaml warns if not all cases are handled.

- The wildcard pattern **\_** matches anything and is used to ignore parts of a structure.

- List recursion is common: recursive functions process head (**x**) and tail (**xs**).

- Prefer tail-recursive functions for performance on large lists.

- Use List module functions (e.g. **List.map**, **List.fold_left**) when possible â€” they are optimized and expressive.

- Patterns can be nested and combined (e.g., (**x :: y :: _**) matches lists with at least two elements).

- OCaml also allows guards (**when** clauses) to add extra matching conditions.
