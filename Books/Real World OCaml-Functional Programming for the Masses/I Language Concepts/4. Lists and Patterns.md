### List Basics
- Lists are built-in, immutable, and singly-linked data structures.
- A list is either:
    - The empty list: `[]`
    - An element prepended to a list via the cons operator: `x :: xs`
- All elements in a list must be of the same type (homogeneous typing).
- List concatenation uses the `@` operator:
    - Has linear time cost proportional to the length of the first list.

### Accessing and Traversing Lists
- Lists do not support random access â€” accessing an index requires recursive traversal.
- Recursion on the head/tail is idiomatic:
    - Process the head (`x`) and recurse on the tail (`xs`).
- Tail recursion is preferred for performance with large lists:
    - Avoids stack overflows by allowing OCaml to optimize with constant stack usage.

### Pattern Matching
- Pattern matching (`match ... with`) is the primary technique for working with list structures.
- Enables destructuring based on the shape of values.
- Patterns bind variables to parts of the structure for convenient extraction.
```ocaml
match lst with
| [] -> ...
| x :: xs -> ...
```

### Let Bindings with Patterns
- Patterns can be used in `let` bindings for destructuring values:
    - Applies to tuples, lists, and other structured types.
```ocaml
let (a, b) = (1, 2)
```

### Match Exhaustiveness
- OCaml requires pattern matches to be exhaustive.
    - The compiler issues warnings if not all cases are covered.
- Use the wildcard pattern `_` to catch unmatched cases or ignore values.

```ocaml
match lst with
| [] -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

### Nested and Combined Patterns
- Patterns can be nested to match specific structures.
- You can combine matches for multiple list elements:
    - `x :: y :: _` matches a list with at least two elements.
- OCaml supports guards (`when`) for adding additional conditions to pattern branches.
```ocaml
match lst with
| x :: _ when x > 0 -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

### The List Module
- Prefer using the List module for standard operations:
    - `List.map`, `List.fold_left`, `List.filter`, etc.
- These are highly optimized, concise, and idiomatic.
- They encapsulate common recursion patterns in safe and reusable ways.
