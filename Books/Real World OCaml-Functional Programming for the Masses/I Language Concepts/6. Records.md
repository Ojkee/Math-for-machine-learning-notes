### What Are Records?
- Records are named product types with labeled fields.
- Similar to structs or objects — but with immutable fields by default.
- Fields are accessed by name, unlike tuples, which use position.

###  Defining a Record
- Use the `type` keyword to define a record:
```ocaml
type person = { name : string; age : int }
```

###  Accessing Fields
- Use dot notation:
```ocaml
person.age
```

### Immutability and Updates
- Record fields are immutable unless marked explicitly:
```ocaml
type counter = { mutable count : int }
```
- Mutate using the `<-` operator:
```ocaml
c.count <- c.count + 1
```
- Use the with keyword to create an updated copy immutably:
```ocaml
{ person with age = person.age + 1 }
```

### Pattern Matching on Records
- Pattern matching can destructure records:
```ocaml
let { name; age } = person
```

### Labels and Scope
- Field labels are global — different record types cannot reuse field names unless scoped via modules.
- To avoid conflicts:
    - Use qualified access (`Module.field`).
    - Use modules to encapsulate.

### Polymorphic Records
- Use type parameters for generic record types:
```ocaml
type 'a boxed = { value : 'a }
```

### When to Use Records
- Prefer records when:
    - Grouping related named values.
    - Structuring function arguments or results clearly.
    - Defining intermediate data structures, e.g., abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
