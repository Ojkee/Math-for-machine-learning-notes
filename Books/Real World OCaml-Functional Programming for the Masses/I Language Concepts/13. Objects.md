### Overview
- OCaml supports first-class objects: values that encapsulate state and behavior together.
- Objects expose named methods; method access is dynamic (late binding).
- The object system is structurally typed — compatibility is determined by method names and types, not by declarations.

### Object Syntax
- Objects are defined using the `object` keyword, followed by a list of method definitions:
```ocaml
let obj = object
	method greet = "hello"
	method add x y = x + y
end
```
- Each `method` defines a behavior; these can be invoked with `obj#method_name`.
- Objects can be returned from functions, passed as arguments, and stored in data structures — they are first-class.

### Object Types
- Object types are inferred structurally:
```ocaml
< greet : string; add : int -> int -> int >
```
- Explicit type annotations can use this object type syntax:
```ocaml
let print_greeting (o : < greet : string >) = print_endline o#greet
```
- If only a subset of methods is required, use `..` to keep the type open:
```ocaml
let f (o : < greet : string; .. >) = o#greet
```

### Polymorphism and Subtyping
- Objects support structural subtyping:
    - Any object with at least the required methods is compatible with the expected type.
- This allows writing functions that operate on any object with a particular method, regardless of the rest of its structure.
- Open object types (`..`) enable polymorphic use of object arguments.

### Encapsulation
- Objects encapsulate state and behavior, often using closures over variables defined in their scope.
- Methods can reference surrounding lexical bindings:
```ocaml
let counter =
	let count = ref 0 in
	object
	method next =
		let v = !count in
		incr count;
		v
end
```
- In this example, the object maintains internal mutable state via a reference cell.

### Self-Reference
- Objects can refer to themselves using the keyword `self`:
```ocaml
let rec obj = object (self)
	method call_again x =
		if x <= 0 then 0 else 1 + self#call_again (x - 1)
end
```
- This allows recursive method calls or passing `self` elsewhere.

### When to Use Objects
- Objects are useful when:
    - You need encapsulation of mutable state.
    - You want late binding of methods (dynamically chosen behavior).
    - You need polymorphic dispatch based on behavior rather than type constructors.
- Common in:
    - Plugin systems.
    - Stateful abstractions.
    - GUI-style or event-driven programming.

### Trade-offs
- Objects are less integrated with pattern matching and type inference.
- They do not support algebraic data decomposition.
- Type errors can be harder to diagnose than with variants and records.
- Prefer using algebraic data types when full visibility and exhaustiveness are needed.
