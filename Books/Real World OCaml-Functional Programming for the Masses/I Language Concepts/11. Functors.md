### What Are Functors?
- Functors are modules parameterized by other modules.
- They allow code reuse and abstraction over modules, similar to generics at the module level.
- Think of functors as module-level functions: they take modules as input and return modules as output.

### Basic Functor Syntax
```ocaml
module type X = sig
	type t
	val compare : t -> t -> int
end

module MakeSet (Ord : X) = struct
	module S = Set.Make(struct
		type t = Ord.t
		let compare = Ord.compare
	end)
	include S
end
```
- `MakeSet` is a functor that takes a module `Ord` of type `X` and returns a module implementing a set over `Ord.t`.

### Using Functors
- First, define a module matching the input signature:
```ocaml
module IntOrd = struct
	type t = int
	let compare = compare
end
```
- Then apply the functor:
```ocaml
module IntSet = MakeSet(IntOrd)
```
- IntSet is now a `module` implementing sets of integers.

### Key Concepts
- Module types define the shape of inputs (like interfaces).
- Functors instantiate modules based on those inputs.
- You can build families of modules that follow the same pattern but differ in internal type or behavior.

### Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Functors support information hiding and separation of concerns.
- Modules passed into functors define key behaviors (e.g. comparison), while the functor defines shared structure (e.g. tree balancing).
- This lets you separate generic logic from domain-specific definitions.

### First-Class vs. Second-Class
- Functors are second-class: you cannot pass them to functions or return them directly.
- But you can apply them at the toplevel or inside modules to produce specialized structures.

### Composing Functors
- Functors can take multiple modules or return other functors:
```ocaml
module F (A : X) (B : Y) = struct ... end
```
- You can nest applications for advanced composition.

### Type Sharing
- Functors often involve type sharing between modules:
```ocaml
module type S = sig
	type t
	val equal : t -> t -> bool
end

module F (M : S) : sig
	val eq : M.t -> M.t -> bool
end = struct
	let eq = M.equal
end
```
- You can use with type constraints to control exposed types precisely.

### Comparison to Object-Oriented Inheritance
- Functors provide parametric modularity without inheritance.
- Unlike OOP:
    - No implicit subtyping.
    - No mutable state or method overriding.
    - All sharing and specialization is explicit via module types.

### Practical Uses
- Implementing data structures (sets, maps, tables) with custom behavior.
- Constructing type-safe abstractions with enforced interfaces.
- Code generation patterns in statically checked modular form.
