### Overview
- OCaml classes are a language feature for defining objects with reusable structure.
- Classes act as object generators — they define a blueprint for creating multiple similar objects.
- A class defines methods, internal fields, and possibly parameters.

### Defining Classes
- Classes are introduced with the `class` keyword:
```ocaml
class point x_init y_init = object
	val mutable x = x_init
	val mutable y = y_init
	method get_x = x
	method get_y = y
	method move dx dy =
		x <- x + dx;
		y <- y + dy
end
```
- This defines a class named point with two parameters **x_init** and **y_init**.
- Each object created from this class has mutable internal fields x and y, and three methods.
- Instantiate with:
```ocaml
let p = new point 1 2
```
- Access methods using `#`:
```ocaml
p#get_x
```

### Fields and Methods
- `val` defines an internal field; `val mutable` allows mutation.
- Methods have access to all internal state.
- Methods can be inherited and overridden in subclasses.
- Fields are not accessible directly from outside — only through methods.

### Self Binding
- Within the object body, the object can be bound to a name using (`self`):
```ocaml
class counter = object (self)
	val mutable count = 0
	method incr = count <- count + 1
	method get = count
	method reset = self#set 0
	method private set x = count <- x
end
```
- `self` is used to refer to the object itself.
- `private` restricts method visibility from outside the class, but is visible for subclasses.

### Class Types
- Class types describe the interface of a class:
```ocaml
class type printable = object
	method print : unit
end
```
- A class can declare that it matches a class type:
```ocaml
class my_printer = object
	method print = print_endline "Hello"
end
```
- This allows polymorphic usage over classes that implement the same interface.

### Inheritance
- Classes support single inheritance via the `inherit` keyword:
```ocaml
class colored_point x y color = object
	inherit point x y
	val c = color
	method color = c
end
```
- Inherited methods and fields are available in the subclass.
- Methods can be overridden in the new class.

### Initializers
- Code in the object body runs when the object is created.
- Use this for initialization logic.

### Polymorphism and Constraints
- Class types can be parameterized:
```ocaml
class ['a] container = object
	val mutable contents : 'a list = []
	method add x = contents <- x :: contents
	method get_all = contents
end
```
- This enables writing generic classes.
- You can constrain method arguments or field types using type variables.

### Objects vs Classes
- Use classes when:
    - You need to create many similar objects with shared structure.
    - You want inheritance and code reuse between related objects.
    - You need encapsulation, state, and dynamic dispatch.
- If only a single instance or ad hoc structure is needed, use object directly.

### Trade-offs
- The class system is expressive, but integrates less naturally with OCaml’s core features like pattern matching and algebraic types.
- Class-based design is not idiomatic for all OCaml code — use it when the problem domain justifies it, especially where state and shared behavior dominate.
