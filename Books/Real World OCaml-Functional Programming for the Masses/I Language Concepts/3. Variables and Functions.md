- **let** is the core binding construct in OCaml; it binds names to values and is immutable by default.

- You can shadow previous bindings — OCaml allows rebinding names in local scopes.

- **let ... in** allows defining values inside expressions — scoped bindings.

- Functions are defined using **let**, just like values; function definitions are expressions too.

- All functions are automatically curried — multi-argument functions are a series of single-arg functions.

- Partial application is natural due to currying — you can supply only some arguments.

 - Parentheses group expressions, not function arguments; function application uses space (**f x y**).

- Anonymous functions are defined with fun, e.g., **fun x -> x + 1**.

- Functions can be nested inside other functions (lexical scoping).

- You can define recursive functions using **let rec**.

- Use and to define mutually recursive functions.

- Functions are first-class values — they can be passed, returned, and stored like any other value.

- OCaml’s type system can infer most function types, including polymorphic types (**'a, 'b**).

- Type errors often result from incorrect assumptions about function application or precedence.

- OCaml enforces no side effects by default — making functions predictable and testable.
