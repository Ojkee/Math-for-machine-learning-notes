### Let Bindings
- `let` is the fundamental construct for binding values to names in OCaml.
- Bindings are immutable by default — once defined, values cannot be changed.
- OCaml allows shadowing: a new `let` with the same name will hide the previous one in scope

### Scoped Bindings
- `let ... in` allows defining local values scoped to a specific expression.
- It enables encapsulation and reuse within a block without polluting outer scopes.
- Useful for step-by-step computations inside expressions

### Function Definitions
- Functions are defined using `let`, just like values.
- Function definitions are expressions and can be passed around or nested.
- Use `let rec` to define recursive functions, such as factorial or Fibonacci.
- Use `and` when defining mutually recursive functions.

### Currying and Partial Application
- All functions are curried by default: a function that takes multiple arguments is actually a sequence of single-argument functions.
- Partial application comes naturally — supplying fewer arguments creates a new function awaiting the rest.
```ocaml
let add x y = x + y
let increment = add 1  (* increment : int -> int *
```

### Function Application
- Function application is done with spaces, not commas:
    - `f x y` means “apply `f` to `x`, then to `y`”.
- Parentheses group expressions, not arguments:
    - `f (x + y)` applies `f` to the result of `x + y`.

### Anonymous Functions and Nesting
- Anonymous functions use the `fun` keyword:
```ocaml
fun x -> x + 1
```
- Functions can be nested inside other functions, capturing variables via lexical scoping.


### First-Class Functions
- Functions in OCaml are first-class citizens:
    - They can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures.
- This enables higher-order programming patterns such as `map`, `filter`, and custom combinators.

### Type Inference and Polymorphism
- OCaml’s type system infers function types automatically, even for polymorphic functions.
- Polymorphic types use type variables like `'a`, `'b`, representing generic functions.

### Common Pitfalls
- Type errors often arise from:
    - Misunderstanding how currying works.
    - Incorrect use of parentheses leading to unexpected function application.

### Functional Purity
- OCaml functions are pure by default — they do not have side effects unless explicitly written.
- This functional purity improves testability, predictability, and reasoning about code.
