Because Processpool and Threadpool implement Executor interface, both are compatible and easy to switch. To make Flag downloader Processpool we change 
```python
# This

# ...
def download_many(cc_list: list[str]) -> int:
	# ...
	with futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
		# ...
		
# To this
# ...
def download_many(cc_list: list[str]) -> int:
	# ...
	with futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
		# ...
```
