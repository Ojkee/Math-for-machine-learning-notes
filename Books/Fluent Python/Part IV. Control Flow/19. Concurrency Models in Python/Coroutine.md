A function that can suspend itself and resume later. In Python, classic coroutines are built from generator functions, and native coroutines are defined with `async def`. Python coroutines usually run within a single thread under the supervision of an event loop, also in the same thread. Asynchronous programming frameworks such as `asyncio`, `Curio`, or `Trio` provide an event loop and supporting libraries for nonblocking, coroutine-based I/O. Coroutines support cooperative multitasking: each coroutine must explicitly cede control with the `yield` or `await` keyword, so that another may proceed concurrently (but not in parallel). This means that any blocking code in a coroutine blocks the execution of the event loop and all other coroutines—in contrast with the preemptive multitasking supported by processes and threads. On the other hand, each coroutine consumes less resources than a thread or process doing the same job.
