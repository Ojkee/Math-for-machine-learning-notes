An instance of a computer program while it is running, using memory and a slice of the CPU time. Modern desktop operating systems routinely manage hundreds of processes concurrently, with each process isolated in its own private memory space. Processes communicate via pipes, sockets, or memory mapped files—all of which can only carry raw bytes. Python objects must be serialized (converted) into raw bytes to pass from one process to another. This is costly, and not all Python objects are serializable. A process can spawn subprocesses, each called a child process. These are also isolated from each other and from the parent. Processes allow preemptive multitasking: the OS scheduler preempts—i.e., suspends —each running process periodically to allow other processes to run. This means that a frozen process can’t freeze the whole system—in theory.
