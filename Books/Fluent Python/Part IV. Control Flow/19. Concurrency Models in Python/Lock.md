An object that execution units can use to synchronize their actions and avoid corrupting data. While updating a shared data structure, the running code should hold an associated lock. This signals other parts of the program to wait until the lock is released before accessing the same data structure. The simplest type of lock is also known as a `mutex` (for mutual exclusion). The implementation of a lock depends on the underlying concurrency model.
