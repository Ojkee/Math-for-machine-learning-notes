An execution unit within a single process. When a process starts, it uses a single thread: the main thread. A process can create more threads to operate concurrently by calling operating system APIs. Threads within a process share the same memory space, which holds live Python objects. This allows easy data sharing between threads, but can also lead to corrupted data when more than one thread updates the same object concurrently. Like processes, threads also enable preemptive multitasking under the supervision of the OS scheduler. A thread consumes less resources than a process doing the same job.
