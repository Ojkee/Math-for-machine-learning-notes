A generic type `L` is invariant when there is no supertype or subtype relationship
between two parameterized types, regardless of the relationship that may exist
between the actual parameters. In other words, if `L` is invariant, then `L[A]` is not a
supertype or a subtype of `L[B]`. They are inconsistent in both ways.
