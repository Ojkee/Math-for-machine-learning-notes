- Favor Object Composition over Class Inheritance
- Understand Why Inheritance Is Used in Each Case
	- Inheritance of interface creates a subtype, implying an “is-a” relationship. This is best done with ABCs.
	- Inheritance of implementation avoids code duplication by reuse. Mixins can help with this.
- Make Interfaces Explicit with ABCs 
- Use Explicit Mixins for Code Reuse
- Provide Aggregate Classes to Users (A class that is constructed primarily by inheriting from mixins and does not add its own structure or behavior is called an aggregate class.)
- Subclass Only Classes Designed for Subclassing
- Avoid Subclassing from Concrete Classes
