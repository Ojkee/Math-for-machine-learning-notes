Both `math.fsum` and `replacer.zip_replace` must iterate over the entire Iterable arguments to return a result.  Given an endless iterable such as the `itertools.cycle` generator as input, these functions would consume all memory and crash the Python process. Despite this potential danger, it is fairly common in modern Python to offer functions that accept an Iterable input even if they must process it completely to return a result. That gives the caller the option of providing input data as a generator instead of a prebuilt sequence, potentially saving a lot of memory if the number of input items is large.
