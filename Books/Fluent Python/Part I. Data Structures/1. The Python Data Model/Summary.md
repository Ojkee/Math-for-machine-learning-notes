- By implementing special methods, your objects can behave like the built-in types, enabling the expressive coding style the community considers Pythonic.

#### Examples
- [[Implementing special methods]]

--------------------

- A basic requirement for a Python object is to provide usable string representations of itself, one used for debugging and logging, another for presentation to end users. That is why the special methods `__repr__` and `__str__` exist in the data model.

--------------------

- Thanks to operator overloading, Python offers a rich selection of numeric types, from the built-ins to `decimal.Decimal` and `fractions.Fraction`, all supporting infix arithmetic operators.
