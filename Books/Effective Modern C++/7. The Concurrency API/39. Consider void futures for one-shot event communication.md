- For simple event communication, condvar-based designs require a superfluous mutex, impose constraints on the relative progress of detecting and reacting tasks, and require reacting tasks to verify that the event has taken place.

- Designs employing a flag avoid those problems, but are based on polling, not blocking.

- A condvar and flag can be used together, but the resulting communications mechanism is somewhat stilted.

- Using **std::promises** and futures dodges these issues, but the approach uses heap memory for shared states, and itâ€™s limited to one-shot communication.
