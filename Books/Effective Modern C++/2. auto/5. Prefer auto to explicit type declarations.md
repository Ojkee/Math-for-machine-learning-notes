-  **auto** variables must be initialized, are generally immune to type mismatches that can lead to portability or efficiency problems, can ease the process of refactoring, and typically require less typing than variables with explicitly specified types.

- **auto**-typed variables are subject to the pitfalls described in Items [[2. Understand auto type deduction|2]] and [[6. Use the explicitly typed initializer idiom when auto deduces undesired types|6]].
