Obsidian vault notes for this book:

# Chapters 
### 1. Deducing Types 
[[1. Understand template type deduction]]
[[2. Understand auto type deduction]]
[[3. Understand decltype]]
[[4. Know how to wiew deduced types]]

### 2. auto
[[5. Prefer auto to explicit type declarations]]
[[6. Use the explicitly typed initializer idiom when auto deduces undesired types]]

### 3. Moving to Modern C++
[[7. Distinguish between ()  and {} when creating objects]]
[[8. Prefer nullptr to 0 and NULL]]
[[9. Prefer alias declarations to typedefs]]
[[10. Prefer scoped enums to unscoped enums]]
[[11. Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones]]
[[12. Declare overriding functions override]]
[[13. Prefer const_iterators to iterators]]
[[14. Declare functions noexcept if they won't emit exceptions]]
[[15. Use constexpr whenever possible]]
[[16. Make const member functions thread safe]]
[[17. Understand special member function generation]]

### 4. Smart Pointers
[[18. Use std..unique_ptr for exclusive-ownership resource management]]
[[19. Use std..shared_ptr for share-ownership resource management]]
[[20. Use std..weak_ptr for std..shared_ptr-like pointers that can dangle]]
[[21. Prefer std..make_unique and std..make_shared to direct use of new]]
[[22. When using the Pimpl Idiom, define special member functions in the implementation file]]

### 5. Rvalue References, Move Semantics, and Perfect Forwarding 
[[23. Understand std..move and std..forward]]
[[24. Distinguish universal references from rvalue references]]
[[25. Use std..move on rvalue references, std..forward on universal references]]
[[26. Avoid overloading on universal references]]
[[27. Familiarize yourself with alternatives to overloading on universal references]]
[[28. Understand reference collapsing]]
[[29. Assume that move operations are not present, not cheap, and not used]]
[[30. Familiarize yourself with perfect forwarding failure cases]]

### 6. Lambda Expressions
[[31. Avoid default capture modes]]
[[32. Use init capture to move objects into closures]]
[[33. Use decltype on auto&& parameters to std..forward them]]
[[34. Prefer lambdas to std..bind]]

### 7. The Concurrency API
[[35. Prefer task-based programming to thread-based]]
[[36. Specify std..launch..async if asynchronicity is essential]]
[[37. Make std..threads unjoinable on all paths]]
[[38. Be aware of varying thread handle destructor behavior]]
[[39. Consider void futures for one-shot event communication]]
[[40. Use std..atomic for concurrency, volatile for special memory]]

### 8. Tweaks
[[41. Consider pass by value for copyable parameters that are chap to move and always copied]]
[[42. Consider emplacement instead of insertion]]
