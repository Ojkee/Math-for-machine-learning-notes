- In principle, emplacement functions should sometimes be more efficient than their insertion counterparts, and they should never be less efficient.

- In practice, they’re most likely to be faster when 
	(1) the value being added is constructed into the container, not assigned;
	(2) the argument type(s) passed differ from the type held by the container;
	(3) the container won’t reject the value being added due to it being a duplicate.

- Emplacement functions may perform type conversions that would be rejected by insertion functions.
