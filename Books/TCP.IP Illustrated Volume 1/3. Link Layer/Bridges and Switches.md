The IEEE 802.1d standard specifies the operation of bridges, and thus switches, which are essentially high-performance bridges. A bridge or switch is used to join multiple physical link-layer networks (e.g., a pair of physical Ethernet segments) or groups of stations. The most basic setup involves connecting two switches to form an extended LAN.
