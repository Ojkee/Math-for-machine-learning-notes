STP works by disabling certain ports at each bridge so that topological loops are avoided (i.e., no duplicate paths between bridges are permitted), yet the topology is not partitionedâ€”all stations can be reached. Mathematically, a spanning tree is a collection of all of the nodes and some of the edges of a graph such that there is a path or route from any node to any other node (spanning the graph), but there are no loops (the edge set forms a tree). There can be many spanning trees on a graph. STP finds one of them for the graph formed by bridges as nodes and links as edges.
