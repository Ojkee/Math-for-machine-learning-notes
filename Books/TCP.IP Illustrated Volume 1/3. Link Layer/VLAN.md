Virtual LAN.

A Virtual LAN is a logical subdivision of a physical Ethernet network and was created to solve the problem of excessive broadcast and multicast traffic in large, any-to-any networks.

Hosts in the same VLAN can talk to each other. Hosts in different VLANs cannot communicate directly; they need a router or Layer 3 switch to connect. 

VLANs also improve security, reduce network congestion, and simplify management.
