Historically, there have been some interoperability problems using autonegotiation, especially when a computer and its associated switch port are configured using different duplex configurations ([[Half Duplex]]/[[Full Duplex]]) or when autonegotiation is disabled at one end of the link but not the other. In this case, a so-called duplex mismatch can occur. 

Perhaps surprisingly, when this happens the connection does not completely fail but instead may suffer significant performance degradation.
