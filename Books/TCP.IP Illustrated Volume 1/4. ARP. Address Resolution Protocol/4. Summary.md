ARP is a basic protocol in almost every [[TCP.IP|TCP/IP]] implementation, but it normally does its work without the application or user being aware of it. ARP is used to determine the hardware addresses corresponding to the [[IPv4 Address|IPv4 addresses]] in use on the locally reachable IPv4 subnet. It is invoked when forwarding datagrams destined for the same subnet as the sending host’s and is also used to reach a router when the destination of a [[Datagram|datagram]] is not on the subnet. The ARP cache is fundamental to its operation, and we have used the arp command to examine and manipulate the cache. Each entry in the cache has a timer that is used to remove both incomplete and completed entries. The arp command displays and modifies entries in the ARP cache. 

We followed through the normal operation of ARP along with specialized versions: proxy ARP (when a router answers ARP requests for hosts accessible on another of the router’s interfaces) and gratuitous ARP (sending an ARP request for your own IP address, normally when bootstrapping). We also discussed address conflict detection for IPv4, which uses a continually operating gratuitous ARP-like exchange to avoid address duplication within the same broadcast domain.
