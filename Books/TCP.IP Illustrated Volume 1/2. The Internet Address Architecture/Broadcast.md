One-to-All communication method where a packet is sent from one sender to all hosts in the same network segment.

- Addressing: Special broadcast address (IPv4: 255.255.255.255 for limited broadcast, or network-directed broadcast like 192.168.1.255).
- Delivery: Every host in the broadcast domain receives the packet, regardless of whether it needs the data.
- Efficiency: Simple, but can cause unnecessary traffic and congestion.
- Examples of use: ARP requests, DHCP discovery
