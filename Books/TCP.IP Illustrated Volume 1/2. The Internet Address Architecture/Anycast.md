A communication method where multiple devices share the same IP address, and the network delivers the packet to the nearest (or best) receiver according to routing metrics.

- Addressing: Same IP address is assigned to multiple hosts (usually servers).
- Delivery: Only one of the possible receivers gets the packet â€“ typically the closest in terms of routing.
- Efficiency: Improves latency and load distribution.
- Examples of use: DNS root servers, Content Delivery Networks, global load balancing
