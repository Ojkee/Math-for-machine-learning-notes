- In this chapter we started with a description of the [[IPv4 Address]] and [[IPv6 Address]] headers, discussing some of the related functions such as the Internet [[Checksum|checksum]] and [[Fragmenting|fragmentation]]. We saw how [[IPv6 datagram|IPv6]] increases the size of addresses, improves upon [[IP]]â€™s method of including options in packets by use of the extension headers, and removes several of the noncritical fields from the [[IPv4 datagram|IPv4]] header. With the addition of this functionality, the IP header increases in size by only a factor of 2 even though the size of the addresses has increased fourfold. The IPv4 and IPv6 headers are not directly compatible and share only the 4-bit Version field in common. Because of this, some level of translation is required to interconnect IPv4 and IPv6 nodes. Dual-stack hosts implement both IPv4 and IPv6 but must choose which protocol to use and when.
