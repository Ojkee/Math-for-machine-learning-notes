If the destination is directly connected to the host (e.g., a point-to-point link) or on a shared network (e.g., Ethernet), the IP datagram is sent directly to the destinationâ€”a router is not required or used. Otherwise, the host sends the datagram to a single router (called the default router) and lets the router deliver the datagram to its destination. This simple scheme handles most host configurations.
