Application Programming Interfaces. 

Applications, whether [[Peer-to-peer|p2p]] or [[Client.Server|client/server]], need to express their desired network operations (e.g., make a connection, write or read data). This is usually supported by a host operating system using a networking application programming interface. The most popular API is called sockets.
