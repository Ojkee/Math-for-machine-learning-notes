Mail Exchanger.

An MX record provides the name of a mail exchanger—a host willing to engage in the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to receive incoming e-mail on behalf of users associated with a domain name. When the Internet was still developing, some sites did not have permanent connections but instead would dial up and connect to hosts that did have permanent Internet connections. In such scenarios, the e-mail destination might be disconnected from the network when e-mail was in transit, so another host would hold on to the mail until the destination was attached. This was one motivation for the inclusion of MX records in the [[DNS]]—to allow sending hosts to deliver e-mail to an intermediary (“relay server”) even if the true destination was not available. Today, MX records are still used, and mail agents prefer to deliver e-mail to the host(s) listed in an MX record associated with a particular domain name.
