The set of all names used with DNS constitutes the DNS name space. This space is partitioned hierarchically and is case insensitive, similar to computer file system folders (directories) and files. The current DNS name space is a tree of domains with an unnamed root at the top. The top echelons of the tree are the so-called top-level domains ([[TLD]]s).
