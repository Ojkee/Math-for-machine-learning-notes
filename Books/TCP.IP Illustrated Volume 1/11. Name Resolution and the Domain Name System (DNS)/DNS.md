DNS is a distributed [[Client.Server|client/server]] networked database that is used by [[TCP.IP|TCP/IP]] applications to map between host names and IP addresses (and vice versa), to provide electronic mail routing information, service naming, and other capabilities.

We use the term distributed because no single site on the Internet knows all of the information. Each site (university department, campus, company, or department within a company, for example) maintains its own database of information and runs a server program that other systems across the Internet (clients) can query.

DNS runs as an application on the Internet, using [[IPv4 Address|IPv4]] or [[IPv6 Address|IPv6]] (or both). For scalability, DNS names are hierarchical, as are the servers that support name resolution.
