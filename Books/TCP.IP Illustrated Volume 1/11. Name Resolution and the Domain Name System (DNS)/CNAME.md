Canonical name.

It is used to introduce an alias for a single domain name into the DNS naming system. For example, the name `www.berkeley.edu` may have a CNAME record that maps to some other machine (e.g., `www.w3.berkeley.edu`), so that if the Web server is located at a different computer, a relatively simple change to the [[DNS]] database may be all that is required for the rest of the world to find the new system. It is now common practice to use CNAME records to establish aliases for common services. As a result, names such as `www.berkeley.edu`, `ftp.sun.com`, `mail.berkeley.edu`, and `www.ucsd.edu` are all CNAME entries in the DNS that refer to other RRs.
