Network Address Translation.

Used in routers and translates set addresses (public) to other set of addresses (private).

Mechanism for allowing the same sets of [[IP]] addresses to be reused in different parts of the Internet. 

Despite its popularity, NAT has several drawbacks. The most obvious is that offering Internet-accessible services from the private side of a NAT requires special configuration because privately addressed systems are not directly reachable from the Internet.
