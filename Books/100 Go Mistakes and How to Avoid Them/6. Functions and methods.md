- The decision whether to use a value or a pointer receiver should be made based on factors such as the type, whether it has to be mutated, whether it contains a field that canâ€™t be copied, and how large the object is. When in doubt, use a pointer receiver.

- Using named result parameters can be an efficient way to improve the readability of a function/method, especially if multiple result parameters have the same type. In some cases, this approach can also be convenient because named result parameters are initialized to their zero value. But be cautious about potential side effects.

- When returning an `interface`, be cautious about returning not a `nil` pointer but an explicit `nil` value. Otherwise, unintended consequences may result because the caller will receive a non-`nil` value.

- Designing functions to receive `io.Reader` types instead of filenames improves the reusability of a function and makes testing easier.

- Passing a pointer to a `defer` function and wrapping a call inside a closure are two possible solutions to overcome the immediate evaluation of arguments and receivers.
