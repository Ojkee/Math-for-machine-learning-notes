- The value element in a `range` loop is a copy. Therefore, to mutate a struct, for example, access it via its index or via a classic `for` loop (unless the element or the field you want to modify is a pointer).

- Understanding that the expression passed to the range operator is evaluated only once before the beginning of the loop can help you avoid common mistakes such as inefficient assignment in `channel` or slice iteration.

- Using a local variable or accessing an element using an index, you can prevent mistakes while copying pointers inside a loop.

- To ensure predictable outputs when using maps, remember that a map data structure
	– Doesn’t order the data by keys
	– Doesn’t preserve the insertion order
	– Doesn’t have a deterministic iteration order
	– Doesn’t guarantee that an element added during an iteration will be produced during this iteration

- Using `break` or `continue` with a label enforces breaking a specific statement. This can be helpful with `switch` or `select` statements inside loops.

- Extracting loop logic inside a function leads to executing a `defer` statement at the end of each iteration.
