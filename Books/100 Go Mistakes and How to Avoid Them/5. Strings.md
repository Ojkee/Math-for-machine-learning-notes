- Understanding that a `rune` corresponds to the concept of a Unicode code point and that it can be composed of multiple bytes should be part of the Go developer’s core knowledge to work accurately with `strings`.

- Iterating on a `string` with the `range` operator iterates on the `runes` with the index corresponding to the starting index of the `rune`’s byte sequence. To access a specific `rune` index (such as the third `rune`), convert the string into a `[]rune`.
- `strings.TrimRight`/`strings.TrimLeft` removes all the trailing/leading `runes` contained in a given set, whereas `strings.TrimSuffix`/`strings.TrimPrefix` returns a string without a provided suffix/prefix.

- Concatenating a list of `strings` should be done with `strings.Builder` to prevent
allocating a new `string` during each iteration.

- Remembering that the `bytes` package offers the same operations as the strings package can help avoid extra `byte`/`string` conversions.

- Using copies instead of substrings can prevent memory leaks, as the `string` returned by a substring operation will be backed by the same byte array.
