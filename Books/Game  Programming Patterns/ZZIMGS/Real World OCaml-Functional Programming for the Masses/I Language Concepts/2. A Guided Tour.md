### Type System & Type Inference
- OCaml has a strong, static type system with powerful type inference.
- Type annotations are usually optional, but helpful for clarity and debugging.
- Types are inferred based on usage and function return types

### Arithmetic and Numeric Literals
- Arithmetic operators are type-specific:
    - `+, -, *, /` → integers
    - `+. -. *. /.` → floating-point numbers
- Underscores can be used in numeric literals for readability
```ocaml
let million = 1_000_000
```

### Bindings ans Functions
- Use `let` for defining values and functions
```ocaml
let x = 5
let add a b = a + b
```
- Bindings are immutable by default
- For mutable values, use `ref`, mutable fields, or arrays

### Function Characteristic
- Functions are curried by default
	- A multi-argument function is actually a chain of single-argument functions
- Promotes a partial application and higher-order programming

### Functional Style and Immutability
- OCaml emphasizes immutability and pure functions:
    - Fewer bugs, easier reasoning, better concurrency.
- Side effects are allowed, but not idiomatic unless necessary

### Higher-Order Functions
- Functions can be passed as arguments, returned, and composed:
    - Functions are first-class values

### Polymorphism
- OCaml supports parametric polymorphism:
    - Generic types like `'a list, 'a -> 'a -> 'a.`
- Ensures type safety without sacrificing flexibility.

### Option Type
- option type is used instead of null
```ocaml
type 'a option = 
	| None 
	| Some of 'a
```
- Promotes safe handling of missing values.

### Pattern Matching
- Essential for deconstructing and inspecting data:
```ocaml
match x with
| Some v -> ...
| None -> ...
```
- Works with tuples, lists, options, variants, etc.

### Composite Types: Tuples and Lists
- Tuples: fixed-size, heterogeneous:
```ocaml
let pair = (1, "hello")
```
- Lists: singly-linked, homogeneous, immutable:
```ocaml
let nums = [1; 2; 3]
```

### User-Defined Types
- Use records and variants to define rich data structures.
- Central to modeling complex problems in a type-safe way

### Mutation and Imperative Constructs
- Mutation is possible via:
    - `ref` for mutable variables
    - `array` for mutable sequences
    - `mutable` fields in records
- Imperative features exist, but functional programming is encouraged

###  Tooling and Compilation
- `utop` is the interactive REPL — ideal for quick experimentation.
- Compilation options:
    - `ocamlc` → compile to bytecode
    - `ocamlopt` → compile to native cod
