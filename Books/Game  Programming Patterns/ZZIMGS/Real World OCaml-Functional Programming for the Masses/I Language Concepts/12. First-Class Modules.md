### What Are First-Class Modules?
- In OCaml, first-class modules are modules that can be treated as values.
- You can:
    - Pass modules to functions
    - Return modules from functions
    - Store them in data structures
- This is unlike regular modules, which are second-class (only usable at the toplevel or in module definitions).

### Syntax: Packaging and Unpacking
- To treat a module as a value, package it using:
```ocaml
(module M : S)
```
- `M` is a module that matches the module type `S`.
- To use the module, unpack it with:
```ocaml
let module M = (val m : S) in ...
```
- Example:
```ocaml
module type SHOW = sig
	val show : int -> string
end

let show_twice (m : (module SHOW)) =
	let module S = (val m : SHOW) in
	S.show 1 ^ ", " ^ S.show 2
```

### First-Class Module Type
- The type of a first-class module is written as:
```ocaml
(module S)
```
- This is a first-class module type, usable in value-level code.

### Use Cases
- Plugin systems: Load behavior dynamically.
- Collections of strategies: Store modules in a list or map.
- Factory patterns: Return different module implementations from a function.

### Abstraction vs. Flexibility
- First-class modules lose some static information:
    - You must explicitly annotate types when unpacking.
    - You can't apply functors directly to first-class modules (you need to unpack first).
- But they increase flexibility:
    - Dynamic module selection at runtime.
    - Use modules where values are expected.

### Example: Selecting Implementations at Runtime
```ocaml
module type LOGGER = sig
	val log : string -> unit
end

let console_logger = (module struct
	let log msg = print_endline ("[console] " ^ msg)
end : LOGGER)

let file_logger = (module struct
	let log msg = (* write to file *) ()
end : LOGGER)

let loggers = [console_logger; file_logger]

List.iter (fun logger ->
	let module L = (val logger : LOGGER) in
	L.log "Hello"
) loggers
```

### Restrictions
- You cannot pattern-match on modules.
- First-class modules cannot define new types — only use existing ones from the signature.
- You must use explicit coercions when types aren’t inferred.

### Comparison to Objects
- Like objects, first-class modules allow runtime dispatch.
- Unlike objects:
    - No inheritance.
    - Modules are closed — no runtime extension.
    - No subtyping — everything must match the declared module type exactly.
