- Command-line parsing is handled using the `Core.Command` module from the Jane Street ecosystem.
- It provides a composable, type-safe interface for building robust command-line applications.

### Defining a Basic Command
- Use `Command.basic` for synchronous commands and `Command.async` for asynchronous ones.
- The general structure is:
```ocaml
open Core

let greet_command =
	Command.basic
		~summary:"Say hello"
		(let open Command.Let_syntax in
		let%map_open name =
			flag "-name" (optional string) ~doc:"NAME name to greet"
		in
		fun () ->
			let who = Option.value name ~default:"world" in
			printf "Hello, %s!\n" who)
```
- `Command.run` executes the command:
```ocaml
let () = Command.run greet_command
```

### Parsing Arguments
- Arguments are defined declaratively:
    - `flag` for named options.
    - `anon` for positional arguments.
    - Use combinators like `let%map_open` for synchronous or `let%bind_open` for asynchronous workflows.
- Types are statically inferred and checked at compile time.
- Argument values are passed to the command body as a closure.

### Subcommands
- Use Command.group to organize multiple commands under one tool:
    - Each subcommand is a named pair with its own Command.t.
```ocaml
let () =
	Command.group ~summary:"Tool with subcommands"
	[ "hello", greet_command
	; "goodbye", goodbye_command
	]
	|> Command.run
```
- This enables CLI tools similar to git, where each subcommand has its own flags and arguments.

### Features of Core.Command
- Automatic help and usage output.
- Clear flag and argument documentation.
- Integration with the async model (`Command.async`).
- Composable and reusable argument definitions.
- Support for default values, required flags, and more.

Best Practices
- Provide a `~summary` for all commands and subcommands.
- Add helpful `~doc` strings for each flag or positional argument.
- Prefer named flags for clarity.
- Use `Command.run` in your programâ€™s entry point.
- For reusable flag definitions, write helper functions returning parsers.

### Notes
- `Core.Command` is built atop the `Cmdliner` library but offers a higher-level and more ergonomic API.
- The design encourages clarity, composability, and safety in CLI development.
