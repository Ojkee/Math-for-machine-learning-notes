- Programming patterns are usually connected to object-oriented programming, but the functional programming world is also filled with often-used idioms and abstractions such as the functor and monad.

- Functors are collection-like structures that know how to apply a transformation function on their contents.

- Monads know everything that functors do, but they have two additional operations: they let you create monadic values from normal values, and they can flatten out nested monadic values.

- Functors allow you to easily handle and transform wrapper types, whereas monads let you compose functions that return wrapper types.

- It’s often useful to think about monads as boxes. But use the term box loosely, to cover cases such as the continuation monad—a box that will eventually contain data.

- You can open a box in the real world to see what’s inside, but this isn’t the case with monads. In the general case, you can only tell the box what to do with the value(s) it has—you can’t always access the value directly.
