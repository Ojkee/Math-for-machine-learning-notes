- By passing specific predicate functions to algorithms such as transform and filter, you change their behavior and make a general algorithm work for a specific problem you have.

- The **std::accumulate** algorithm lives in the $\bf{\text{<numeric>}}$ header, but it’s applicable to many more areas than just performing simple calculations.

- **std::accumulate** implements a concept called folding that isn’t limited to addition and multiplication and can be used to implement many standard algorithms.

- If you don’t want to change the order of selected elements in a list while dragging them, it’s better to use the **std::stable_partition** algorithm instead of **std::partition**. Similarly, in a UI, **std::stable_sort** is often preferable to **std::sort**.

- Although STL algorithms are meant to be composed, they aren’t meant to be composed the same way as algorithms in other functional programming languages. This will be easily remedied when you start using ranges.

- The fact that most standard algorithms are implemented as loops isn’t a reason to use handwritten loops instead. In the same way, while, if, and others are implemented using gotos (jumps)—but you don’t use goto statements, because you know better.
