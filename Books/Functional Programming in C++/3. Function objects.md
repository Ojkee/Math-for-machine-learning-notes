- It’s possible to use objects that are castable to function pointers as if they were ordinary functions, but the call operator is the preferred way of creating function objects.

- For functions whose return type isn’t important enough to be explicitly stated, you can let the compiler deduce it from the value you’re returning by using the auto keyword.

- Using the automatic return type deduction avoids any type of conversion or nar- rowing that might arise when you specify the type explicitly (for example, returning a double value in a function that should return an int). 

- If you want to create a function object that can work on a multitude of types, you should make its call operator a function template.

- Lambdas are useful syntactic sugar for creating function objects. Using them is usually better than writing whole classes with call operators by hand.

- Lambdas in C++14 have become a true replacement for most function objects that you could write by hand. They add new possibilities when capturing variables, and they support creating generic function objects.

- Although the lambdas provide terser syntax for creating function objects, they’re still overly verbose for some cases. In those situations, you can use the libraries such as Boost.Phoenix, or roll out your own function objects.

- The std::function is a useful, but it comes with a performance penalty equivalent to a virtual function call.
