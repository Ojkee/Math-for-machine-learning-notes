- The main optimization in all immutable data structures, which are also called persistent, is data sharing. It allows you to keep many slightly modified versions of the same data without the memory overhead you’d have if you used the classes from the standard library.

- Having an efficient way to store past values of a variable allows you to travel through the history of your program. If you store all the previous states of your program, you can jump back to any of them whenever you want.

- Similar modifications exist for other structures as well. For example, if you needed an immutable associative container, you could use red-black trees, modified to share the data between different instances, similar to what you did for the bitmapped vector trie.

- Immutable data structures have always been an active area of research. Many contributions came from academia (as is often the case with functional programming), as well as from developers.

- It’s always worth checking which structures would be suited best for any particular case. Unlike the go-to collection in C++ (**std::vector**), all immutable data structures have downsides (even if they’re as magical as bitmapped vector tries). Some of them might not be well suited for a given case.
