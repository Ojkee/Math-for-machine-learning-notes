- Most computers have multiple processing units. When writing programs, you need to ensure that your code works correctly in multithreaded environments.

- If you overuse mutexes, you’ll limit the level of parallelism your program can achieve. Because of the need for synchronization, program speed doesn’t grow linearly with the number of processors you’re using.

- Mutable state isn’t necessarily bad; having it is safe as long as it isn’t shared between multiple system components at the same time.

- When you make a member function const, you promise that the function won’t change any data in the class (not a bit of the object will change), or that any changes to the object (to members declared as mutable) will be atomic as far as the users of the object are concerned.

- Copying the entire structure when you want to change only a single value isn’t efficient. You can use special immutable data structures to remedy this ([[8. Functional data structures|chapter 8]] covers immutable data structures).
