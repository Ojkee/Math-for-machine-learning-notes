- Most C++ programmers write procedural code. I recommend reading Object Thinking by David West (Microsoft Press, 2004) to help you start writing better object-oriented code. It’s beneficial even when you’re doing functional programming.

- Humans tend to achieve grand things when they talk to one another. We don’t have a shared mind, but the ability to communicate helps us achieve complex goals. This is the reasoning that led to the invention of the actor model.

- Monads can cooperate well. You shouldn’t be afraid to stack them on each other.

- You can implement transformations for reactive streams similar to those for input ranges. You can’t implement things such as sorting on them, because for sorting you need random access to all elements, and you don’t even know how many elements a reactive stream will have—they’re potentially infinite.

- Just like futures, common implementations of reactive streams aren’t limited to sending values; they can also send special messages such as “stream ended.” This can be useful for more efficient memory handling: you can destroy a stream when you know it won’t send you any more messages.
