- Higher-order functions such as **std::bind** can be used to transform existing functions into new ones. You can get a function of n arguments and easily turn it into a unary or a binary function that you can pass to algorithms such as **std::partition** or **std::sort** with **std::bind**.
 
- Placeholders give you a high level of expressiveness when defining which function arguments shouldn’t be bound. They allow you to reorder the arguments in the original function, to pass the same argument multiple times, and so forth.

- Although **std::bind** provides a terse syntax to do partial function application, it might have performance penalties. You may want to consider using lambdas when writing performance-critical code that’s often invoked. They’re more verbose, but the compiler will be able to optimize them better than the function objects created by **std::bind**.

- Designing an API for your library is hard. Many use cases need to be covered. Consider creating an API that uses curried functions.

- One of the often-heard statements about functional programming is that it lets you write shorter code. If you create functions that are easily composed, you can solve complex problems with a fraction of the code the usual imperative programming approach would take.
