- One frequent source of errors when using STL algorithms is passing incorrect iterators to them—sometimes even iterators belonging to separate collections.

- Some collection-like structures don’t know where they end. For those, it’s customary to provide sentinel-like iterators; these work but have unnecessary performance overhead.

- The ranges concept is an abstraction over any type of iterable data. It can model normal collections, input and output streams, database query result sets, and more. The ranges proposal is planned for inclusion in C++20, but libraries provide the same functionality today.

- Range views don’t own the data, and they can’t change it. If you want to operate on and change existing data, use actions instead.

- Infinite ranges are a nice measure of algorithm generality. If something works for infinite ranges, it’ll work for finite ones as well.

- By using ranges and thinking of program logic in terms of range transformations, you can decompose the program into highly reusable components.
