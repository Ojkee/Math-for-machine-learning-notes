- Every pure function is a good candidate to be unit tested. You know what it uses to calculate the result, and you know it doesn’t change any external state—its only effect is that it returns a result.

- One of the most famous libraries that does property-checking against a randomly generated data set is Haskell’s QuickCheck. It inspired similar projects for many programming languages, including C++.

- By changing the random function, you can change which types of tests are more often performed. For example, when generating random strings, you can favor shorter strings by using a random function with normal distribution and with mean zero.

- Fuzzing is another testing method that uses random data. The idea is to test whether software works correctly given invalid (random) input. It’s highly useful for programs that accept unstructured input

- Remembering the initial random seed allows you to replicate tests that have failed.

- Correctly designed monadic systems should work without problems if the continuation monad or reactive streams are replaced with normal values and normal data collections. This allows you to switch on and off concurrency and asynchronous execution on the fly. You can use this switch during testing.
