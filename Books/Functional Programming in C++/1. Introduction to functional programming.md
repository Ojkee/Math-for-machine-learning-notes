- The main philosophy of functional programming is that you shouldn’t concern yourself with the way something should work, but rather with what it should do.

- Both approaches—functional programming and object-oriented programming—have a lot to offer. You should know when to use one, when to use the other, and when to combine them.

- C++ is a multiparadigm programming language you can use to write programs in various styles—procedural, object-oriented, and functional—and combine those styles with generic programming.

- Functional programming goes hand-in-hand with generic programming, especially in C++. They both inspire programmers not to think at the hardware level, but to move higher.

- Function lifting lets you create functions that operate on collections of values from functions that operate only on single values. With function composition, you can pass a value through a chain of transformations, and each transformation passes its result to the next.

- Avoiding mutable state improves the correctness of code and removes the need for mutexes in multithreaded code. 

- Thinking functionally means thinking about the input data and the transformations you need to perform to get the desired output
