- Templates give you a Turing-complete programming language that is executed during program compilation. This was discovered accidentally by Erwin Unruh, who created a C++ program that prints the first 10 prime numbers during compilation—as compilation errors.

- TMP is not only a Turing-complete language; it’s also a pure functional language. All variables are immutable, and there’s no mutable state in any form.

- The type_traits header contains many useful metafunctions for type manipulation.

- From time to time, because of limitations or missing features in the core programming language, workarounds are added to the standard library. For example, **std::invoke** allows you to call all function-like objects, even those that don’t support the regular function-call syntax.

- DSLs are tedious to write but let you significantly simplify the main program logic. Ranges are also DSLs, in a sense; they define an AST for defining range transformations using the pipe syntax.
